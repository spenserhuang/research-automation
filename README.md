# Research Automation Stage Redesign

<br />To start the program, use terminal on the Raspberry Pi to move to the directory containing the `final.py` file and run the following code: `sudo python final.py`

<br />This is the code portion for the research automation project by Dr. John Finan. For a full report on his work, visit https://www.jove.com/pdf/57305/jove-protocol-57305-method-for-high-speed-stretch-injury-human-induced-pluripotent-stem

<br />See `final.py` for final code & code explanation

<br />See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tyzGtYq4kWMPX398z9ARpwwB-9m6vzB-E2wSU4SHoPk/edit for documentation on the circuitry
